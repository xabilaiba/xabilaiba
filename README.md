- 👋 Hi, I’m Xabier Laibarra and I work at Vaillant since February 2023. I work as a Business Intelligence Specialist in the IQ-Q department.
- 👀 I’m interested in sports, literature, languages, good food and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to improve my Tableau and data visualization skills, Machine Learning knowledge and coding habilities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on eveything that has to do with data quality and R&D use cases in order to improve Vaillant's products, specially in the Heat Pump field.
- 📫 If you want to reach me, feel free to write a Teams message any time :)

Thanks for reading my profile and see you soon!
